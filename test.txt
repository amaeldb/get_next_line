Where are you goin'? Can I come too?
The whole world is open, a playground for me and you
And we could be fine, shit, who the hell knows?
It's your eyes and your ears and your mouth and your nose
Head and your shoulders, your knees and your toes
I dream of this moment
Will it come true?
The whole world, they know it
They just waitin' for me and you
And she, just like I
Got her head in the clouds
Don't need to be lower
Before it's all over, I promise we'll figure it out
I ain't comin' down
Why would I need to?
So much of this world is above us, baby
They might tell you that I went crazy
I'm just tryna read you
Ooh, ooh, oohh
Ooh-ooh-oohh
